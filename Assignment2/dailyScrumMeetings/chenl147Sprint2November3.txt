What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Tested FileSystem was working properly
    - Tested ChangeDirectory and PrintWorkingDirectory
    - Polished the code for MakeDirectory

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continue updating the FileSystem to accomodate any needs for other classes 
    - Test the code of FileSystem, ChangeDirectory and PrintWorkingDirectory and MakeDirectory

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Testing the code efficiently is hard without our prototype shell being fuctional
