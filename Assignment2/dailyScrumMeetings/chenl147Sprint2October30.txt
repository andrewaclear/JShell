What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Polished the FileSystem: added a tracker for the current directory, more methods, more significant variable names and documentation
    - Completed the code and documentation for ChangeDirectory and PrintWorkingDirectory
    - Started the code and documentation for MakeDirectory
    - Tested the File and Directory classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continue updating the FileSystem to accomodate any needs for other classes 
    - Test the code of FileSystem, ChangeDirectory and PrintWorkingDirectory

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I am unsure how to implement ChangeDirectory in a way that satisfies condition
    - Testing the code efficiently is hard without our prototype shell being fuctional
