            + "door sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had\r\n"
            + "appeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to\r\n"
            + "a large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose\r\n"
            + "rings he drew off their fingers.  A sword and a loaf of bread were\r\n"
            + "lying there, which he carried away.  After this, he entered a\r\n"
            + "chamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw\r\n"
            + "him, kissed him, and told him that he had set her free, and should\r\n"
            + "have the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year\r\n"
            + "their wedding should be celebrated.  Likewise she told him where the\r\n"
            + "spring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw\r\n"
            + "some of it before the clock struck twelve.  Then he went onwards, and\r\n"
            + "at last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed,\r\n"
            + "and as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little.  So he\r\n"
            + "lay down and fell asleep.\r\n" + "\r\n"
            + "When he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve.  He sprang up in\r\n"
            + "a fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood\r\n"
            + "near, and hastened away.  But just as he was passing through the iron\r\n"
            + "door, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such\r\n"
            + "violence that it carried away a piece of his heel.\r\n" + "\r\n"
            + "He, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went\r\n"
            + "homewards, and again passed the dwarf.  When the latter saw the sword\r\n"
            + "and the loaf, he said, With these you have won great wealth, with\r\n"
            + "the sword you can slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to\r\n"
            + "an end. But the prince would not go home to his father without his\r\n"
            + "brothers, and said, Dear dwarf, can you not tell me where my two\r\n"
            + "brothers are?  They went out before I did in search of the water of\r\n"
            + "life, and have not returned.\r\n" + "\r\n"
            + "They are imprisoned between two mountains, said the dwarf. I have\r\n"

            + "prince begged until the dwarf released them, but he warned him and\r\n"
            + "said, Beware of them, for they have bad hearts. When his brothers\r\n"
            + "came, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that\r\n"
            + "he had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with\r\n"
            + "him, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a\r\n"
            + "year for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he\r\n"
            + "would obtain a great kingdom.\r\n" + "\r\n"
            + "After that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war\r\n"
            + "and famine reigned, and the king already thought he must perish, for\r\n"
            + "the scarcity was so great.  Then the prince went to him and gave him\r\n"
            + "the loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom,\r\n"
            + "and then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the\r\n"
            + "hosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace.  The\r\n"
            + "prince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers\r\n"
            + "rode on.  But after this they entered two more countries where war\r\n"
            + "and famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his\r\n"
            + "sword to the kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after\r\n"
            + "that they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea.  During the\r\n"
            + "passage, the two eldest conversed apart and said, The youngest has\r\n"
            + "found the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him\r\n"
            + "the kingdom - the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of\r\n"
            + "all our fortune. They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with\r\n"
            + "each other to destroy him.  They waited until they found him fast\r\n"
            + "asleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took\r\n"

            + "\r\n"
            + "Now therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to\r\n"
            + "the sick king in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured.\r\n"
            + "But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he\r\n"
            + "became still worse than before.  And as he was lamenting over this,\r\n"
            + "the two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having\r\n"
            + "intended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true\r\n"
            + "water of life, and handed it to him.  He had scarcely tasted it, when\r\n"
            + "he felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in\r\n"
            + "the days of his youth.\r\n" + "\r\n"
            + "After that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said, You\r\n"
            + "certainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we\r\n"
            + "the gain, you should have been cleverer, and should have kept your\r\n"
            + "eyes open.  We took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea, and\r\n"
            + "when a year is over, one of us will go and fetch the beautiful\r\n"
            + "princess. But beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our\r\n"
            + "father, indeed he does not trust you, and if you say a single word,\r\n"
            + "you shall lose your life into the bargain, but if you keep silent,\r\n"
            + "you shall have it as a gift.\r\n" + "\r\n"
            + "The old king was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had\r\n"
            + "plotted against his life.  So he summoned the court together and had\r\n"
            + "sentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot.\r\n"
            + "And once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no\r\n"
            + "evil, the king's huntsman was told to go with him, and when they were\r\n"
            + "quite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the\r\n"
            + "prince said to him, Dear huntsman, what ails you? The huntsman\r\n"
            + "said, I cannot tell you, and yet I ought. Then the prince said,\r\n"
            + "Say openly what it is, I will pardon you. Alas, said the\r\n"
            + "huntsman, I am to shoot you dead, the king has ordered me to do it.\r\n"
            + "Then the prince was shocked, and said, Dear huntsman, let me live,\r\n"
            + "there, I give you my royal garments, give me your common ones in\r\n"
            + "their stead. The huntsman said, I will willingly do that, indeed I\r\n"
            + "would not have been able to shoot you. Then they exchanged clothes,\r\n"
            + "and the huntsman returned home, while the prince went further into\r\n"

            + "After a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the\r\n"

            + "slain their enemies with the prince's sword, and maintained their\r\n"

            + "The old king then thought, Can my son have been innocent? And said\r\n"

            + "that I have suffered him to be killed. He still lives, said the\r\n"
            + "huntsman, I could not find it in my heart to carry out your\r\n"
