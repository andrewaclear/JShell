# To Do

### echo
- [ ] send correct error message for `echo as > sd`
- [ ] might not want to still print out in `echo "add"sd"`, maybe just error



### ls, cat, man

- [x] add .. and . To ls (maybe to file system)
- [ ] Ls cat and man must stop and not look for another argument once they reach an error 
  - [x] ls
  - [ ] cat
  - [ ] man



### dstack

- [x] Only push a valid path to dstack





### note sure

- [ ] should we make `"(.+)?[ /.!@#$%^&*(){}~|<>?](.+)?"` a CONSTANT?
- [ ] remove unnecessary prints



#### for ALL Commands

- [x] all have `@Override`
- [ ] all have JavaDoc, CHRISTIAN some of your classes don’t have a comment before them
- [x] all have comments in long code
- [x] good indenting
- [ ] update CRC cards
- [ ] make sure ONLY `StandardOutput` is used to print





#### touch ups

- [ ] remove commented code
- [ ] Fix spelling
- [x] No underscores 
- [ ] Appropriate error for bad character input 
- [ ] remove so of the other print outs??



### Question

- are we supposed to say “given string” or the parameter name in the the javadoc descriptions?
